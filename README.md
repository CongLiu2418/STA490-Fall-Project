# STA490-Fall-Project
Sept 2022 - Dec 2022 

A news article reports that people can achieve similar typing speed on mobile phones as on computer keyboards. To confirm this finding, we measured typing speed and typing performance factors of students enrolled in STA490. Through multiple linear regression, we show that across individuals, the most significant predictors of typing speed on a mobile phone are keyboard typing speed (p ≈ 0.0004) and mobile phone type (p ≈ 0.0066). People who type fast on a keyboard **also** type faster on a mobile device.
